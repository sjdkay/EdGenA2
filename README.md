EdGenA2 Event Generator
==================

This code is for an Event Generator for the A2 collaboration.
It uses the ROOT (root.cern.ch) PhaseSpace generator has basis and 
See http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~lzana/Documents/zana_haspect_genova2014.pdf for a quick presentation on this code.

Prerequisites
-------------
* CERN ROOT  (tested at now with version ROOT 5.34/09
* git 
* cmake

Install
-------
This version is running correctly on ifarm.jlab.org. The version of cmake there is too old, so, just use /work/halla/parity/disk2/zana/Cmake/cmake-2.8.8/bin/cmake rather than the default cmake.
* cd EdGenA2 (go to the EdGenA2 directory)
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ../ ( at jlab /work/halla/parity/disk2/zana/Cmake/cmake-2.8.8/bin/cmake ../ )
* make 

Running
-------
* cd EdGenA2/output (go to the output directory)
* A table with particle properties is in this directory (from PDG) eg_pdg_table.txt :Modify it if you need it. An example of how to add particles to this table are written at the end of the file. At now the information used are just the mass, the charge of the particle and the lifetime (if the particle has vertex in your reaction diagram for this MonteCarlo. 
* A template is in input.dat (input_test.dat it is just for my developments at now), and modify the file to fit your reaction
* In input.dat one can specify the input spetrum (for example for CLAS photon beam). The input spectrum file is written in a txt files format with raw that represent for each bin E_min, E_max, Counts (Does not need to be normalize, the code is going to normalize it if need it). The bin size do not need to be the same for each bin.  An example is written in the output directory as energy.txt 
* ./EdGenA2 -h will give you the options
* ./EdGenA2 -i input.dat -o output.root        (Change input.dat or output.root (need to be a *.root) to your desired input and output file format

Models
-------
* 1 Phase Space Single Energy (for example e-)
* 2 Phase Space Energy Spectrum (for example gamma)
* 3 Cross Section (sorry, not yet)
* 4 Amplitudes (sorry, not yet) 
* 5 Data Points (sorry, not yet)

Mass Models
-------
(Mass model: if width of particle>1MeV, one can generate the mass according to different distributions)
* 1 Breit-Wigner (Mass and Width are automatically read from output/eg_pdg_table.txt)
* 2 Flat (Generated flat in mass in the allowed range)
* 3 Just the mass at the center of the distribution
* 4 Gaussian and more to come


output
-------
* 1  ROOT only
* 2  ROOT + LUND
* 3  ROOT + BOS
* 4  ROOT + A2
Examples
-------
* 3 particles in a vertex, Dalitz plots are generate using the weight (for particles that decay with more than 2 particles in a vertex). The weight is an array of all the particles and describe the weight at creation (the weight is given to the decayed particles) <br />
** Create generated output file: ./EdGenA2 -i input_test2.dat <br />
** Analyze the output (with TProof) of the generated file (files analysis.C , analysis.h, run_analysis.C): root run_analysis.C <br />
** NB The weight is given as a single number (the product of the weights at each vertex) in the BOS and LUND File: For the BOS file the weight is included in the MCHD bank (check that you bank is keeped in all the step of your analysis); For the LUND file format, the weight is included where should be the value of the mass in the LUND format (since it is not used by gemc). <br />
* 2 particles per vertex, but 3 vertex <br />
** Create generated output file: ./EdGenA2 -i input_test.dat <br />
** Analyze the output (with TProof) of the generated file (files newAnalysis.C , newAnalysis.h, run_newAnalysis.C): root run_newAnalysis.C <br />
* Photon production phasespace Omega + pi+ + pi- <br />
** Create generated output file: ./EdGenA2 -i input_test_5.dat <br />
** Analyze the output (with TProof) of the generated file (files analysis_5.C , analysis_5.h, run_analysis_5.C): root run_analysis_5.C <br />
* Photon production phasespace a2->Omega + pi+ + pi- <br />
** Create generated output file: ./EdGenA2 -i input_test_6.dat <br />
** Analyze the output (with TProof) of the generated file (files analysis_6.C , analysis_6.h, run_analysis_6.C): root run_analysis_6.C <br />
* For A2 examples see input_dan.dat and input_A2.dat
