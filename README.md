EdGen Event Generator
==================

This code is for a common Event Generator for the HASPECT collaboration.
It uses the ROOT (root.cern.ch) PhaseSpace generator has basis and 
See http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~lzana/Documents/zana_haspect_genova2014.pdf for a quick presentation on this code.
This version respect to the common version it supports the BOS output format (for CLAS6 analysis) if the system has it.

Prerequisites
-------------
* CERN ROOT  (tested at now with version ROOT 5.34/09
* git 
* cmake
* Tested on ifarm.jlab.org on June 5 2014. Needs CLAS software (and OLD CERN LIBS) 
* Environment variables on ifarm.jlab.org
setenv CERNLIB /apps/cernlib/x86_64_rhel4/2005/lib
setenv CVSROOT /group/clas/clas_cvs
setup cernlib tcl
source /group/clas/builds/environment.csh

Install
-------
This version is running correctly on ifarm.jlab.org. The version of cmake there is too old, so, just use /work/halla/parity/disk2/zana/Cmake/cmake-2.8.8/bin/cmake rather than the default cmake.
* cd EdGen (go to the EdGen directory)
* mkdir build
* cd build
* if you want to install BOS output support you will need to have correctly setup in your environment variables CLAS6LIB CLAS6INC and CERNLIB (the environment show before has been tested)
* if you don't want BOS support, just unset those environment variables (CLAS6LIB CLAS6INC and CERNLIB). If you will request a BOS output the code will not create any bos file (strangely enough)
* open EdOutput.h and uncomment line 5 : #define CLAS6LIB . This will compile also the part of the code with BOS banks functions.
* cmake ../ ( at jlab /work/halla/parity/disk2/zana/Cmake/cmake-2.8.8/bin/cmake ../ )
* make 

Running
-------
* cd EdGen/output (go to the output directory)
* A table with particle properties is in this directory (from PDG) eg_pdg_table.txt :Modify it if you need it. An example of how to add particles to this table are written at the end of the file. At now the information used are just the mass, the charge of the particle and the lifetime (if the particle has vertex in your reaction diagram for this MonteCarlo. 
* A template is in input.dat (input_test.dat it is just for my developments at now), and modify the file to fit your reaction
* In input.dat one can specify the input spetrum (for example for CLAS photon beam). The input spectrum file is written in a txt files format with raw that represent for each bin E_min, E_max, Counts (Does not need to be normalize, the code is going to normalize it if need it). The bin size do not need to be the same for each bin.  An example is written in the output directory as energy.txt 
* ./EdGen -h will give you the options
* ./EdGen -i input.dat -o output.root        (Change input.dat or output.root (need to be a *.root) to your desired input and output file format
